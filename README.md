# Discord Plays Celeste

A discord bot to present the game [Celeste](https://www.celestegame.com/) with interactive controls to a channel, one screenshot at a time.

This is made of two components:
- The Discord bot backend itself in Typescript that starts the game and interfaces with it.
- A mod for [Everest](https://everestapi.github.io/) to interface closely with the game. Only tested on version 5635.

The bot is meant to run headless on a Linux server.
